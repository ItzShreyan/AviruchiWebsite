    <h1>Our Story</h1>

    <p>
      Aviruchi was born from a simple belief: the true taste of India should be experienced exactly as it was meant to be—authentic, pure, and crafted with heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every one of our snacks and sweets is 100% homemade, prepared by master artisans across India who honour culinary traditions refined over generations. Their craft is slow, intentional, and deeply rooted in heritage. No factories. No industrial shortcuts. Only time‑honoured recipes and meticulous handwork.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once created, our delicacies are shipped directly from India, preserving the freshness, aroma, and character of their origin. Opening a box of Aviruchi is an invitation to experience India’s true flavours—just as you would in a cherished local shop, where every bite carries a story.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aviruchi is a celebration of authenticity. A bridge between cultures. A commitment to preserving the artistry of Indian snacking and sweet‑making. We bring you not just food, but a taste of tradition—delivered with integrity, care, and an unwavering respect for where it all began.
    </p>
